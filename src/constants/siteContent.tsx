    <p>
      I'm Devon. I'm a software engineer, a creative writer and editor, and a
      lover of things whimsical and strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am perpetually curious, and I work best when I can experiment and learn
      something new.
    </p>
    <p>
      My technical background is primarily in web application development
      (TypeScript/JavaScript), but I'm always looking to stretch my knowledge
      and am comfortable with a variety of languages and approaches. Take a peek
      at the resume tab if you want to know more.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      To see what I've been tinkering with lately, visit my profile on {makeNewTabLink('https://github.com/devon-wolf', 'GitHub')}.
